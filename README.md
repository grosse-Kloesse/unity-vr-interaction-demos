# Unity VR Interaction Demos

A small Unity (C#) VR interaction pack created for teaching/demo purposes.  
Focus: reusable interaction modules + UI-driven workflows.

## Highlights
- **Surgical Light Control**: brightness + color temperature adjustment via UI sliders
- **Smart Door Interactions**:
  - proximity sensor auto-open
  - key insertion + handle rotation unlock workflow
  - collision rebound / self-closing behavior
- **Hospital Bed**: button-controlled backrest elevation (smooth motion + limits)
- **Ordering UI**: select item + quantity +/- + confirm → spawn & drop physical objects

## Tech Stack
- Unity, C#
- XR: (add what you used: XR Interaction Toolkit / OpenXR / SteamVR)

## Industrial Background (Thesis)
Built a 3D model of a chemical plant and evaluated observability across different VR setups (e.g., CAVE vs. Quest),
deriving guidelines for visualization and platform-specific trade-offs.

## Notes
This repository is intended as a compact portfolio showcase. Some large assets may be omitted to keep it lightweight.
